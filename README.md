## Install (Homebrew)
```
brew tap roblibob/minute
brew install --cask minute
```

## Install (Manual)
1. Download the latest DMG from GitHub Releases.
2. Open the DMG and drag `Minute.app` into Applications.
3. Launch Minute from Applications.

## What this fork adds

This is a personal fork of [`roblibob/minute`](https://github.com/roblibob/minute). It follows upstream and adds the changes below; offline Russian transcription is the main reason it exists.

- **Russian transcription (GigaAM).** Adds a third transcription backend that handles Russian offline on Apple Silicon, running [GigaAM](https://github.com/salute-developers/GigaAM) through `sherpa-onnx`. Long recordings are split with Silero VAD and decoded per speech segment, so timestamps and speaker diarization stay intact. Pick the RNN-T or CTC variant in settings; model files download from Hugging Face and are checksum-verified, like the Whisper models. arm64, macOS 14+, Russian only.
- **Live transcription progress.** The status drawer shows position, speed and ETA while transcribing, measured in decoded speech so skipped silence does not inflate the bar. Diarization gets its own "Identifying speakers" stage, and loudness normalization shows a moving bar instead of a static fraction.
- **Faster Parakeet.** The Parakeet encoder runs on the GPU on Apple Silicon, about 8% faster with no accuracy change, and FluidAudio is pinned to v0.15.1 for the newer encoder and diarization model.
- **Smaller vault audio.** Recordings are stored as M4A (AAC) by default instead of uncompressed WAV, roughly an order of magnitude smaller. Imports keep their original quality, and a separate 16 kHz WAV still drives transcription and diarization. Change the format under Settings → Vault → Audio format.
- **Download sizes in the model pickers.** Each GigaAM and Whisper option shows its download size, both in settings and during onboarding.
- **Unsigned DMG releases.** A manual GitHub Actions workflow builds an ad-hoc-signed, arm64-only DMG. There is no Apple Developer certificate, so the build is not notarized and the Sparkle updater is off; clear the download quarantine after installing. Homebrew and the signed releases still come from upstream.

## Key Features

### Total Audio Capture
* **System Audio & Mic Mixed:** Record your Teams calls, Google Meets, or Discord chats directly. No virtual audio cables or "bot" participants required.
* **Participant Memory:** Minute can remember people between meetings, so speaker names auto-resolve faster and your notes stay instantly familiar.
* **Process video:** Turn already recorded video files into summaries.

### Vision-Enhanced Context
* **See What Was Said:** Minute can optionally capture and understand screen context snapshots during recording.
* **Disambiguation:** If a speaker refers to "this chart" or "that code block," the AI uses the visual context to write a more accurate summary.

### Deterministic Obsidian Output
* **No "Wall of Text":** Unlike generic chat bots, Minute uses constrained JSON generation to force the LLM into a strict schema.
* **Vault-Ready:** Writes directly to your local folder.
    * ✅ Valid YAML Frontmatter (Date, Tags, Duration).
    * ✅ Clean Markdown headers and properties.
    * ✅ Links to the full transcript and audio for reference.
    * ✅ Capture up to 25 different languages.
    * ✅ Create your own meeting types with custom summary instructions.

### 100% Private & Offline
* **Apple Silicon Native:** Runs `Fluidaudio/Parakeet` (for transcription) and `Llama/Gemma 3` (for screen context and summarization) entirely on your Mac's Neural Engine.
* **Zero Data Leak:** Unplug your ethernet cable—it still works. Your meetings never touch a server.


## Why I Built Minute
I live in Obsidian, but I was frustrated by the state of AI tools for macOS.

Most existing solutions forced me into one of two compromises:
1.  **Privacy Trade-offs:** Sending my private journals and meeting notes to cloud APIs (OpenAI/Anthropic) felt wrong and is often not acceptable for my clients.
2.  **The Workflow Gap:** Most tools just dump text. Minute is engineered to produce *structured data* that actually fits into my workflow.

I built **Minute** to be the tool I wanted to use: a **native, lightweight Swift application** that respects the "Local-First" philosophy of Obsidian. It runs entirely on your device, uses your Mac's dedicated Neural Engine, and never asks for a credit card. It has one purpose and does it well.

## Comparison

| Feature | ⚡️ Minute | ☁️ Other tools
| :--- | :--- | :--- | 
| **Privacy** | ✅ **Local (Device Only)** | ❌ Cloud Processed | 
| **Cost** | ✅ **Free / OSS** | ❌ $10–$30/mo | 
| **Audio Source** | ✅ **Mic + System Audio** | ❌ Requires "Bot" to join(usually) |
| **Workflow** | ✅ **Direct Vault Write** | ❌ Copy/Paste required | 
| **Latency** | ✅ **Real-time (On-chip)** | ❌ Network Lag | 
| **Context** | ✅ **👀 Vision/Screen Aware** | ❌ Audio Only |

# Zoom Kitten Filter Incident - 27th Judicial District

## Summary
During a court hearing in the 27th Judicial District, Rod Ponton experienced a persistent Zoom kitten filter on his video feed. Despite attempts to remove it with assistance from his assistant, the issue remained unresolved. The judge highlighted the potential for recording violations and issued a warning about prohibited recordings. No formal decisions were made regarding the filter.

## Decisions

## Action Items
- [ ] Ensure Zoom video settings are configured correctly to prevent filter activation. (Owner: Rod Ponton)

## Open Questions
- What specific steps were taken to remove the filter?

## Key Points
- A Zoom kitten filter was present during the court hearing.
- The judge cautioned against recording the proceedings.
- Mr. Ponton was unable to resolve the filter issue independently.
